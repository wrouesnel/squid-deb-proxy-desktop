squid-deb-proxy-desktop
=======================

A modified version of squid-deb-proxy more suited for desktop and developer use.

A PPA of this package is available at https://launchpad.net/~w-rouesnel/+archive/squid-deb-proxy-desktop

This package is oriented towards user flexiblity: it will cache any deb-looking files which are requested of it from any source - there are no ACLs restricting it by default, but it will not allow nor parse normal html content (squid-deb-proxy will provided it comes/goes to various URLs).

The squid-deb-proxy-desktop-client package has also been modified to be aware of squid-deb-proxy running on the local machine - during invocation it will poll the network for other squid-deb-proxy instances (in fact anything that broadcasts as _apt_proxy._tcp. over avahi) and set them as cache_peers for a local squid instance.

This allows installing squid-deb-proxy-desktop on a laptop, and using it to provision virtual-machines efficiently - but having that instance dynamically acquire cached content from your desktop (or supply cached content to your desktop) when you're back home/in the office.
